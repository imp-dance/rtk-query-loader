# Deferring queries

Say you have a query that takes a long time to resolve. You want to put it in the loader, to co-locate it with the rest of your queries, but you don't want it to affect the loading state and postpone the initial load of the component. This is where `deferredQueries` comes in.

## Example

```typescript {3-13}
const loader = createLoader({
  useQueries: () => {
    const importantQuery = useImportantQuery();
    const slowQuery = useSlowQuery();

    return {
      queries: {
        importantQuery,
      },
      deferredQueries: {
        slowQuery,
      },
    };
  },
  transform: (loader) => ({
    important: loader.queries.importantQuery.data, // ImportantQueryResponse
    slow: loader.deferredQueries.slowQuery.data, // SlowQueryResponse | undefined
  }),
});
```

## Configure

> **New in version 1.0.3**

You can pass a `Config` to your `Loader`s:

```typescript {4-8}
const loader = createLoader({
    useQueries: () => ({...}),
    onError: () => (...),
    config: {
        deferred: {
            shouldThrowError: true,
        },
    }
})
```

- `shouldThrowError` - Determines whether or not `deferredQueries` should send the component to the `onError` view if one of the deferred queries end up in a error state.
