# Features

RTK Query Loader tries to give you all the flexibility you need to create reusable and extendable loaders.

- Supply as many queries as you'd like.
- Supply queries that [don't affect loading state](defer-queries).
- Send down payloads that contain any static data.
- [Transform](./transforming) the data to your desired output-format.
- Set up [default](../Quick%20Guide/base-loader) loading and error states.
- [Extend](./extending) and re-use existing loaders.
- Create [stateful loaders](./stateful-loader)

And even if you don't use `RTK Query`...

- Supply queries that are [just promises](../Reference/use-create-query).
- [Use with other data loading libraries](./other-libs)
