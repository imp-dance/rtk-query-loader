# Extend

You can **extend** existing `Loader`s. This lets you inherit and overwrite properties from an existing `Loader`.

## Example

```tsx
const parentLoader = createLoader({
    onLoading: () => <div>Loading...</div>
});

const childLoader = parentLoader.extend({
    useQueries: () => ({...}),
    onError: () => <div>Error</div>,
}).extend({
    transform: () => ({...}),
}).extend({
    onLoading: () => <div>Overwritten loading...</div>,
});
```

## Separation of concerns

Its up to you how much you want to separate logic here. Some examples would be...

- Co-locating loaders in a shared folder
- Co-locating loaders in same file as component
- Co-locating loaders in same directory but in a separate file from the component

I personally prefer to keep the loaders close to the component, either in a file besides it or directly in the file itself, and then keep a base loader somewhere else to extend from.

## Creating a loader hierarchy

You can extend from any loader, including loaders that have already been extended. This allows you to create a hierarchy of loaders that can be used to share logic between components.

## Tips

:::caution `.extend` will not merge what two separate `useQueries` returns.
For example, you cannot _just_ inherit the deferredQueries, you must either inherit or overwrite the whole `useQueries` argument.

:::tip Reusable transformers
You can extend as many times as you'd like. You can use this feature to easily inject reusable snippets, like transformers.

```typescript
type QueryRecord = Record<string, UseQueryResult<unknown>>;

export const transformData = {
  transform: (data: {
    queries: QueryRecord;
    deferredQueries: QueryRecord;
    payload: unknown;
  }) => {
    // handle transformation in generic way
  },
};
```

```typescript
const loader = createLoader({...}).extend(transformData);
```
