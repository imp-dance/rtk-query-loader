# Features

RTK Query Loader tries to give you all the flexibility you need to create reusable and extendable loaders.

- Supply multiple queries.
- Supply queries that are [not from RTK](../Exports/use-create-query.md).
- Supply queries that [don't affect loading state](defer-queries.md).
- [Transform](./transforming.md) the queries to your desired output-format.
- [Extend](./extending.md) existing loaders.
- Re-use existing loaders
