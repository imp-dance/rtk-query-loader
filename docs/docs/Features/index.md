# Features

RTK Query Loader tries to give you all the flexibility you need to create reusable and extendable loaders.

- Supply multiple queries.
- Supply queries that [don't affect loading state](defer-queries.md).
- [Transform](./transforming.md) the queries to your desired output-format.
- [Extend](./extending.md) existing loaders.
- Re-use existing loaders

And even if you don't use `RTK Query`...

- Supply queries that are [just promises](../Exports/use-create-query.md).
- [Use with other data loading libraries](./other-libs.md)
