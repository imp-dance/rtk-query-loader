# What problem does this solve?

**Handling the loading and error state of components that depend on external data can be tedious,
especially when you are managing multiple queries.**

### Example

This component requires some data. There are 26 lines of code that are **just** concerned with ensuring that the data is present before rendering the _actual_ component.

```typescript {2-28}
const Component = () => {
  const pokemonQuery = useGetPokemon("charizard");
  const userQuery = useGetCurrentUser();
  const userStatsQuery = useGetUserStats();

  if (
    pokemonQuery.isLoading ||
    userQuery.isLoading ||
    userStatsQuery.isLoading
  ) {
    return <LoadingView />;
  }

  if (
    pokemonQuery.isError ||
    userQuery.isError ||
    userStatsQuery.isError
  ) {
    return (
      <ErrorView
        error={
          pokemonQuery.error ??
          userQuery.error ??
          userStatsQuery.error
        }
      />
    );
  }
  // Finally...
  return (
    <ComponentWithData
      pokemon={pokemonQuery.data}
      user={userQuery.data}
      userStats={userStatsQuery.data}
    />
  );
};
```

RTK Query Loader lets you **move all of this logic out of the component**, and also make it _reusable_ and _composable_, so that other components can reuse that loader and have access to the same data.

- [x] Isolate the data-loading code away from the presentational components
- [x] Increase type certainty
  - 🔥 Way less optional chaining in your components
  - 🔥 You write the components as if the data is already present
- [x] Composability
  - ♻️ Extend existing loaders
  - ♻️ Overwrite only select properties
- [x] You're still fully in control
  - 🛠️ Loading/error states
  - 🛠️ Custom loader-component
  - 🛠️ Configure the behavior of your loaders

## Alternatives

If you are using a Suspense-enabled framework, or any form of server-side rendering that can feed your components with data, then that would be a more optimal approach. [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/1.14.3/route/loader) has the concept of loaders built in, and NextJS is suspense enabled.

If you are, however, building an SPA, or not using Next or Remix, then this package can be a great way for you gain the concept of loaders without moving to server-side rendering.
